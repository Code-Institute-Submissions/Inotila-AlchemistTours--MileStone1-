## Visit Namibia

Visit Namibia is a website for people considering to travel to Namibia. The site users are people considering travleing to Namibia and would like to know more about what the country has to offer. Because the main aiprot is 60km away from the capital city, users will also be looking to book a shuttle from the airport. In addition, users would like information about what they should bring with to Namibia.

The site owner, a particpiant of the Namibian tourism indusrty, would like to provide rialble information about the coutnry.
