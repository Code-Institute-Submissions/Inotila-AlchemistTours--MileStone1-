# Portfolio 1,

This project is for my final submision for my first milestone. The aim of the project is to code and deploy a static website using HTML and CSS.

## Alchemist Tours

Alchemist Tours is a website for a company that offers shuttle services to and from Windhoek International airport as well as aound the city of Windhoek. In order to market themselves they have created a website that lets people know about their serives and also offer them an opportunity to book a shuttle online. In addition, the website also promotes travel to the country so as to grow the tourism industry. Users of the are as ealry people who will be traveling to Windhoek Namibia( the countries only international airport) and will be indeed of transport to or from the airport as it is 60kms away from the City and one can not hitch a taxi from there. In addition, users are people considering travleing to Namibia and would like to know more about what the country has to offer.

The site owner, is a shuttle compnay. The company would like to make offer potential clients an opportunity to book their services online. Furthermore, provide market tourim in Namibia and provide rialble information about the country.

## Potential features

## Value

This site is for the conviences of booking transport for toursit in and around the Windhoek. Furthermore, this site is provide  prospective travelers with info about Namibia and give them a look (via the gallery) at what beautys Namibia has to offer. The webisite aims at marketing the country, so as to boost the toursim industry. 

## Testing
I test if this page works in different browsers.

I ensured that the project is reponsive, and the deisign looks good by using a minimalist approach. In addition I used the devtools to confirm that all sizes look good.

I ensured that the page is readable, and that it is easy to understand the page and the actions that are afforded to the user.

I have confirmed that all my inputs and fields work and accept the correct data format.

## Bugs and fixes
I didn't come across too many bugs as the page is solely HTML and CSS. The bugs I came across where links that didn't work because I had a syntax error. Other common bugs were images not loading on other devices because my file path was wrong. I failed to include the (.) to indicate that it document was being loaded from the current file path.

While testing I had feedback that the submit button lead particpants to an error page. They didn't not enjoy this even if they were just testing. So to fix this I put the button into an anchor element that lead to an thank you page. However,this didn't work no matter what I tried. the error that kept showing up indicated that the form is a post and so command was not being accepted. So my solution was to change the form method from post to get. While this is not what the form is for, it improved the testing process.

I had issues with the navigation menu when the screen went lower than 950px and lower. It would not align properly,so to fix this I changed the float for element from float right to float left. This made it look better.

## Unfixed bugs
No unfixed bugs

## Validator testing
Html -no errors returned from the official w3c validator

CSS -no errors returned from the official (jigsaw) validator

Accesibility -Conofimation that the colors and fonts used are easy to read and are accessible  by running it throught lighthouse in devtools.

I researched from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ to help me create this project. 

My friend Brav Regimus contributed to this project by advising me to use felx to fix my issue with having the fotter not stick to the bottom.

I researched how to excute ceterain codes on stack overflow to set up my banner to be animated. Futhermore, I used discussions on layouts to guide me to bettering my layout. https://stackoverflow.com/
